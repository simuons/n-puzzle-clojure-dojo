# n-puzzle

The n-puzzle is a board game for a single player. It consists of (n^2 - 1) numbered squared tiles in random order, and one blank space ("a missing tile"). The object of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space, using the fewest moves. Moves of the puzzle are made by sliding an adjacent tile into the empty space. Only tiles that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the blank space (not diagonally adjacent) may be moved.
